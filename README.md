Project Introduction:
If you watch a film or series and enable closed captions (CC), you get subtitles for all audible information -- so not only voices, but also the subtitles also contain a sound description in brackets, like [music] or [explosion] or [R2D2 beeps cheerily]. This should be possible to automate with deep learning. Data for 50 different classes of sounds are available in this dataset:
